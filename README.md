College project

This project is to explore my interests in game design which are storytelling and music.
This game was made with Twine, developing my knowledge of how HTML works and how it can be used to creatively design a text-based game.
I plan on using Bandlab and flat.io to compose some background music for my game.
Using Github, I can host a website with links to any media or material I'd like to use within any of my projects.
